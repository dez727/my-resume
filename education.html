                    <dt>Object-Oriented Programming I</dt>
                    <dd>
                        A first course in computer programming, problem solving and
                        software design using an object-oriented language. Programming
                        topics include: data types and variables, assignment and
                        expressions, standard input/output, branches/selection,
                        repetition, arrays, functions/methods, and objects.
                        Problem solving and software design techniques include:
                        algorithm development and pseudocode, debugging, and UML class diagrams.

                    <dt>Generative Al & Data Analysis</dt>
                    <dd>This course provides an accessible introduction to using
                        generative AI for business and data analysis. Designed for
                        students without prior coding experience, it focuses on
                        practical applications of large language models (LLMs)
                        like GPT to enhance decision-making, streamline workflows,
                        and develop AI-powered tools. Students will learn key
                        concepts such as prompt engineering as well as using AI
                        within Python. The course also covers techniques for
                        validating data and ensuring the reliability of AI-generated
                        outputs, helping to create accurate and dependable solutions.
                        Hands-on activities will guide students in applying AI to automate
                        tasks such as customer service, report generation, and data analysis
                        through simple Python-based exercises.

                    <dt>Database Systems in Business</dt>
                    <dd>
                        This course is a study of database systems in the context of their use in business
                        to support information systems and decision-making. The course places special emphasis
                        on data access using SQL and includes application development using a commercial database
                        management system such as Oracle and SQL Server. Other topics include database concepts,
                        data modeling, database design and development, administration of database systems, and
                        technologies.

                    <dd>
                        This is a core course that will provide an overview of: scientific principles on which studies
                        of
                        the environment are based; on current understandings of environmental problems from a
                        scientific perspective; and evaluation of scientific evidence.
