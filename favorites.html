                    <h3>The Tragedy of Great Power Politics by John Mearsheimer</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Tragedy of Great Power Politics is a book by John Mearsheimer,
                        a political scientist and international relations scholar. The book
                        argues that the inherent nature of great powers leads them to seek
                        dominance over others, resulting in conflict and war.
                        Mearsheimer contends that the international system is anarchic,
                        and that great powers are driven by the desire for security and power.
